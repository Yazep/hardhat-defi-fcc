# Hardhat DeFi Project

## Introduction
I'm Andrei Yazepchyk, an emerging developer focused on learning Solidity and JavaScript. This project, a part of my educational journey, is inspired by Patrick Collins' JavaScript Blockchain/Smart Contract FreeCodeCamp Course. It emphasizes DeFi development using Hardhat, targeting the Ethereum Sepolia testnet.

## Project Overview
This project is centered around DeFi functionalities, specifically interacting with the AAVE protocol. It's designed to demonstrate the core capabilities of blockchain development using Hardhat and Ethereum's Sepolia testnet.

### Features
- **Interacting with AAVE**: Enables direct interaction with the AAVE contract.
- **Network Forking**: Utilizes network forking for a realistic and controlled development environment.
- **DeFi Operations**:
  - **Deposit Collateral**: Allows users to deposit collateral into the AAVE protocol.
  - **Borrow Assets**: Enables borrowing of assets like DAI against the collateral.
  - **Repay Borrowed Assets**: Facilitates the repayment of borrowed assets like DAI.
